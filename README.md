Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate learner who loves exploring new concepts and diving into various fields of tech. I enjoy solving problems and building projects using React and C++. I'm also working on improving my skills in Linux, command line tools, and version control with Git and GitHub.

When I'm not coding, I like to challenge myself with problem-solving tasks and continuously expand my knowledge. I'm always excited to learn something new and take on new challenges
